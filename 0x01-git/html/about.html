    <h1>asked me to write a my personal profile </h1> 
    Hi there, my name is Priscilla and I am excited to share a little bit about myself with you. I am a 20 year-old woman who was born and raised in a small town in the midwest. I come from a tight-knit family and am the oldest of four siblings, which has taught me the importance of responsibility and leadership from a young age.

I am currently pursuing my master's degree in psychology and hope to one day become a licensed therapist. I have always been fascinated by human behavior and the way people interact with each other. I believe that my empathetic and compassionate nature will make me a great therapist, and I am eager to use my education and skills to help others.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and spending time with my friends and family. I find great joy in nature and often find myself seeking out new trails to explore. I am also an avid reader and enjoy getting lost in a good book. My favorite genres include non-fiction, self-help, and memoirs.

I am a strong believer in the power of community and have always been involved in volunteering and giving back. In college, I was a mentor for underprivileged children, and I continue to donate my time and resources to local organizations that support causes close to my heart.

One of my biggest passions is traveling and experiencing different cultures. I have been fortunate enough to visit several countries in Europe and Asia, and I am always planning my next adventure. I believe that travel is one of the best ways to broaden your perspective and gain a deeper understanding of the world.

Overall, I would describe myself as kind, curious, and driven. I am excited for the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to continuing to grow and learn as a person.
